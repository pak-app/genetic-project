# Solving Problems Using Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is one of algorithms that designed to solve problems with some samples and we want guess a sample (gene) and value it using fitness function.
<br>So we have some problems has been solved using this algorithm and you can learn and enjoy.</br>
Projects are located on master branch.
